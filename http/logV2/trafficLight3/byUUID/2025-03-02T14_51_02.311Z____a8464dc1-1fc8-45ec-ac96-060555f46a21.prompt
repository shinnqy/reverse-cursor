## Current Code
Here is the current code file path:
src/components/test.ts

Here is the current code around the cursor position:

```
<|current_cursor_position|>function changeLight(light: TrafficLight) {
  switch (light) {
    case light.RED:
      console.log('RED');
      break;
    case light.YELLOW:
      console.log('YELLOW');
      break;
    default:
      console.log('Invalid light');
      break;
  }
}
```

## Task
Rewrite the code from the first column of the line of <|current_cursor_position|> according to the following requirements:
1. Enforce PascalCase naming for all enum members
2. Propagate naming convention changes to all related cases
3. Preserve original functionality
4. Apply changes to entire code regardless of cursor position
5. Focus on code after cursor position

# Output Format
Return ONLY the rewritten code from the first column of the line of cursor position without any other words.
Do NOT include unchanged code before cursor.
