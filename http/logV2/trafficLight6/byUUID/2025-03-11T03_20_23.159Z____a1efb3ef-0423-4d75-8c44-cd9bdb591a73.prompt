You're an expert in TypeScript. Your task is to help the user update the code around current cursor position.

## Recent Actions
Here is what the user has been doing from the earliest to the latest:

File: src/components/test2.ts
deleted the code `enum TrafficLight {` in line 1
deleted the code `  Red = 'red',` in line 2
deleted the code `  Yellow = 'yellow',` in line 3
deleted the code `  Green = 'green',` in line 4
deleted the code `}` in line 5
deleted the code `` in line 6
deleted the code `function changeLight(light: TrafficLight) {` in line 7
deleted the code `  if (light === TrafficLight.Red) {` in line 8
deleted the code `    return TrafficLight.Green;` in line 9
deleted the code `  } ` in line 10
deleted the code `  console.log('light', light);` in line 11
deleted the code `}` in line 12
deleted the code `` in line 13
added the code `function cha` in line 1


## Current Code
Here is the current code file path:
src/components/test2.ts

Here is the current code around the cursor position:

```
function cha<|current_cursor_position|>
```

## Task
Rewrite the code from the first column of the line of <|current_cursor_position|> according to the following requirements:
1. Enforce code format strictly matching existing code style.
2. Propagate naming convention changes to all related cases
3. Preserve original functionality
4. Apply changes to entire code regardless of cursor position
5. Focus on code after cursor position

# Output Format
Return ONLY the rewritten code from the first column of the line of cursor position without any other words.
Do NOT include unchanged code before cursor.
Never use markdown formatting like ```. Return raw text only.
