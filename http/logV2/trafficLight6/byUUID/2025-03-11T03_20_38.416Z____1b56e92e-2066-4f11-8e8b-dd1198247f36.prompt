You're an expert in TypeScript. Your task is to help the user update the code around current cursor position.

## Current Code
Here is the current code file path:
src/components/test2.ts

Here is the current code around the cursor position:

```
function changeLight(light: TrafficLight) {
  switch (light) {
    case TrafficLight.Red:
   <|current_cursor_position|>   return TrafficLight.Green;
    case TrafficLight.Green:
      return TrafficLight.Yellow;
      
  } 
}

```

## Task
Rewrite the code from the first column of the line of <|current_cursor_position|> according to the following requirements:
1. Enforce code format strictly matching existing code style.
2. Propagate naming convention changes to all related cases
3. Preserve original functionality
4. Apply changes to entire code regardless of cursor position
5. Focus on code after cursor position

# Output Format
Return ONLY the rewritten code from the first column of the line of cursor position without any other words.
Do NOT include unchanged code before cursor.
Never use markdown formatting like ```. Return raw text only.
