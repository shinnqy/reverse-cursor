## Current Code
Here is the current code file path:
entry/src/main/ets/utils/dynamicProp.ets

Here is the current code around the cursor position:

```
<|editable_region_start|>
interface Address {
  city: string;
  country: string;
}
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address: Address;
<|current_cursor_position|>    city: string;
    country: string;
  };
}
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    country: "USA",
  },
<|editable_region_end|>
};

const greeting = `Hello, ${user.name}!`;



```

## Task
Rewrite the code from the first column of the line of <|editable_region_start|> to the line of <|editable_region_end|> according to the following requirements:
1. Enforce code format strictly matching existing code style.
2. Propagate naming convention changes to all related cases
3. Preserve original functionality
4. Apply changes to entire code regardless of cursor position
5. Focus on code after cursor position at <|current_cursor_position|>

# Output Format
Return ONLY the rewritten code from the first column of the line of <|editable_region_start|> to the line of <|editable_region_end|> without any other words.
Never use markdown formatting like ```. Return raw text only.
