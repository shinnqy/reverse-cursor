You're an expert in ArkTS. Your task is to help the user update the code around current cursor position.

## Recent Actions
Here is what the user has been doing from the earliest to the latest:

File: entry/src/main/ets/utils/twoWayBinding.ets
added the code `  @Link t` in line 16

deleted the code `  @Link t` in line 16
added the code `  @Link ta` in line 16


## Current Code
Here is the current code file path:
entry/src/main/ets/utils/twoWayBinding.ets

Here is the current code around the cursor position:

```
@Entry
@Component
struct ParentComponent {
  @State parentCount: number = 0;

<|editable_region_start|>
  build() {
    Column() {
      Text(this.parentCount.toString())
      LinkChildComponent()
    }
  }
}

@Component
struct LinkChildComponent {
  @Link ta<|current_cursor_position|>

  build() {
    Column() {
      Button()
        .onClick(() => {
          //
        })
    }
  }
}
<|editable_region_end|>

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

@Component
struct ComplexBindingExample {
  @State user: User = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

  build() {
    Column() {
      Text(this.user.name)
    }
  }
}

@Component
struct UserEditor {

  build() {
    Column() {
      Text("")
      Text("")
    }
  }
}



```

## Task
Rewrite the code from the first column of the line of <|editable_region_start|> to the line of <|editable_region_end|> according to the following requirements:
1. Enforce code format strictly matching existing code style.
2. Propagate naming convention changes to all related cases
3. Preserve original functionality
4. Apply changes to entire code regardless of cursor position
5. Focus on code after cursor position at <|current_cursor_position|>

# Output Format
Return ONLY the rewritten code from the first column of the line of <|editable_region_start|> to the line of <|editable_region_end|> without any other words.
Never use markdown formatting like ```. Return raw text only.
